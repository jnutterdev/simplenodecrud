## A Simple CRUD APP

The focus of this project is to learn how to interact with CRUD options using Express.js and Postgres. So far, it has basic operations like GET user, POST user, UPDATE user, and DELETE user. 


#### Need to fix:
- Need to be able to create database automatically (currently db, user, and table needs to be created manually )
- Setup routes for Update and Delete users
- Put app behind user authentication

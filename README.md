## A Simple CRUD APP

The focus of this project is to learn how to interact with CRUD options using Express.js and Postgres. So far, it has basic operations like GET user, POST user, UPDATE user, and DELETE user. 


#### Need to fix:
- The POST user response doesn't include the id of the user created
- Setup routes for Update and Delete users
- Put app behind user authentication
